## Question

Can you generate use case diagrams for the above requirements?

## Answer

I'll try to create a simplified Use Case Diagram based on the provided requirements. Please note that this is a text-based representation, and actual UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams would be more comprehensive.

**Use Case Diagram: Procurement Assistant System**

**Actors:**

* **Division User**: Represents employees from various divisions within Changi Airport Group who initiate procurement requests.
* **Procurement Team**: Responsible for managing the procurement process, providing data, and reviewing Waiver of Competition (WOC) justifications.
* **System Administrator**: Manages the Procurement Assistant System, including configuration, maintenance, and updates.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Initiate Procurement Request**
	* Division User requests procurement of goods or services
	* Precondition: Division User has a valid login account
	* Postcondition: Procurement request is created and stored in the system
2. **Guide Through Procurement Process**
	* System provides step-by-step guidance to Division User on procurement process
	* Precondition: Procurement request exists
	* Postcondition: Division User completes procurement process with assistance from the system
3. **Provide Past and Existing Procurement Data**
	* System displays relevant past and existing procurement data to Division User
	* Precondition: Procurement request exists
	* Postcondition: Division User has access to relevant procurement data
4. **Analyze and Recommend Procurement Approach**
	* System evaluates procurement request and recommends the best approach
	* Precondition: Procurement request exists
	* Postcondition: Recommended procurement approach is displayed to Division User
5. **Generate Procurement Templates and Recommendations**
	* System generates relevant templates (e.g., requirement specifications, instructions to tenderers) and recommendations for Division User
	* Precondition: Procurement request exists
	* Postcondition: Generated templates and recommendations are displayed to Division User
6. **Review and Approve WOC Justifications**
	* Procurement Team reviews and approves WOC justifications submitted by Division User
	* Precondition: WOC justification is submitted
	* Postcondition: WOC justification is approved or rejected
7. **Maintain System Configuration and Updates**
	* System Administrator manages system configuration, maintenance, and updates
	* Precondition: None
	* Postcondition: System is updated and configured correctly

**Relationships:**

* Division User initiates procurement request (Use Case 1)
* System guides Division User through procurement process (Use Case 2)
* System provides past and existing procurement data to Division User (Use Case 3)
* System analyzes and recommends procurement approach (Use Case 4)
* System generates procurement templates and recommendations (Use Case 5)
* Procurement Team reviews and approves WOC justifications (Use Case 6)
* System Administrator maintains system configuration and updates (Use Case 7)

This simplified Use Case Diagram illustrates the main interactions between actors and the system. Please note that actual UML diagrams would include more details, such as boundary conditions, exceptions, and relationships between use cases.
