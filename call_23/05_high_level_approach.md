## Question

how would you provide a high level outline for the new Procurement Assistant System and what is the suggested approach to develop a prototype?


## Answer

Based on the provided context, I would suggest the following high-level outline for the new Procurement Assistant System:

**System Components:**

1. **User Interface**: Interactive chatbot that guides users through the procurement process using prompters and search functions.
2. **Knowledge Base**: Centralized database of past procurement awards, requirement specifications, prices, and market insights.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: AI-powered engine that analyzes user inputs and provides recommendations on procurement approach, templates, and potential suppliers.
4. **Integration Layer**: Connects to existing systems, such as internal supplier databases and procurement management software.

**System Workflow:**

1. User initiates a new procurement request through the chatbot interface.
2. The chatbot asks standard questions to gather information about the procurement requirements.
3. The Recommendation Engine analyzes user inputs and provides recommendations on:
	* Procurement approach (Direct Award, Limited Sourcing, Open Sourcing, Exemption)
	* Relevant templates (draft requirement specifications, instructions to tenderers, CoC)
	* Estimated procurement value
	* Potential suppliers
4. User reviews and fine-tunes the recommendations.
5. The system generates a draft procurement package, including the recommended templates and supporting documents.

**Suggested Approach for Developing a Prototype:**

1. **Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Identify the most critical features and functionalities to include in the initial prototype.
2. **Choose a Development Framework**: Select a suitable framework for building the chatbot interface, such as Dialogflow or Microsoft Bot Framework.
3. **Design the Knowledge Base**: Develop a basic knowledge base with sample data to support the Recommendation Engine.
4. **Develop the Recommendation Engine**: Use machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to develop the Recommendation Engine.
5. **Integrate with Existing Systems**: Connect the prototype to existing systems, such as internal supplier databases and procurement management software.
6. **Test and Refine**: Conduct user testing and refine the prototype based on feedback and performance metrics.

**Prototype Development Timeline:**

Assuming a team of 2-3 developers, designers, and subject matter experts, I would suggest a development timeline of approximately 12-16 weeks for the initial prototype. This will allow for:

* 4 weeks for requirements gathering and MVP definition
* 4 weeks for chatbot interface development
* 4 weeks for knowledge base design and Recommendation Engine development
* 2-4 weeks for integration, testing, and refinement

Please note that this is a rough estimate and the actual development timeline may vary depending on the complexity of the project and the resources available.
