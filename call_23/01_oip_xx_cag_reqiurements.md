# Procurement Assistant Tool/System for CAG

## Description of CAG

Changi Airport Group (CAG) operates and manages Changi Airport.

It is responsible for ensuring smooth airport operations and management, air hub development, commercial activities and airport emergencies services.

It also manages the Changi East development project, which includes the building of a new Terminal 5 for Changi Airport.

As one of Asia’s most connected international aviation hubs, Changi Airport links Singapore to some 150 cities globally, with close to 100 airlines operating more than 6,800 flights weekly and offers over 600 F&B and retail outlets.

Changi Airport has won over 680 accolades for its consistent and excellent airport staff service, passenger experience and safety standards.

CAG’s procurement team is tasked with efficiently managing the acquisition of essential goods and services crucial to CAG's operations.

They actively support division users throughout the procurement process, ensuring rigorous adherence to governance, compliance, and ethical standards that align with the organisation's overarching objectives and values.

## Problem Statement

How might CAG develop a procurement assistant tool that guide users through the end-to-end procurement process, improving the quality of Waiver of Competition (WOC) requests submitted and enhancing overall efficiency?

## Current Issues

Currently, there is a lack of end-to-end procurement sourcing capabilities.

Whilst procurement processes and requirements are made available to CAG division users, users typically require support from the procurement team throughout the end-to-end sourcing process – including decisions on procurement routes, developing requirement specifications, and recommendations of potential suppliers (Refer to Annex – Diagram A: End-to-End Procurement
Sourcing Process).

The process can take up to a week for strengthening of justifications especially with regards to Waiver of Competition (WOC) submissions, mostly due to insufficient information and adequate justification from users.

The CAG procurement team of four handles up to 1,000 requests annually, totalling over 750 man-hours of effort.

Key issues that contribute to larger than expected man-hour resources spent on the procurement
process are:

a) Crafting new requirement specifications from scratch or referencing outdated or sub-optimal past ones may lead to incorrect procurement methods or overly restrictive requirements, limiting potential suppliers.
Manually extracting past examples by CAG Procurement team for the division users is time-consuming.

b) Manual sourcing of information on potential suppliers is taxing on division users.
Knowledge gaps could result in reliance on internal supplier database and limits diversification into new suppliers.
Users may also be unaware of suitable suppliers appointed by other CAG divisions.
In most cases, on top of manual sourcing, division users are involved in the running of daily operations.

c) Division users are unsure of the right procurement approach that best fits their needs.
The types of procurement approach, each with distinct procedures and paperwork, are:
- Direct Award: directly awarding contract to specific supplier without a competitive bidding process, as only one supplier has the capability to meet the procurement requirements.
- Limited Sourcing: inviting only a limited number of pre-selected suppliers to bid, ensuring a competitive but controlled process as controls must be in place to ensure fair process
- Open Sourcing: bidding is open to the public and any supplier is free to bid under the tender process.
- Exemption: normal procurement procedures may not be applicable (e.g., transactions with government bodies such a licensing fees, stamp duties, taxes, etc.) thus such procurement are exempted from sourcing and waiver procedures.

Coupled with the limited understanding of justification criteria, division users often struggle to choose the best approach or realise their procurement qualifies for an exemption.
As a result, direct awards are frequently chosen approach, even when not the most appropriate.

d) Determining estimated procurement value (EPV) for open sourcing procurements, for example,Quotation or Tender, which typically references:
- Price of previous purchases
- Current price lists
- Similar items in related industries
- Opinion of specialists
- Personal knowledge or information from any other appropriate resources

The lack of a centralised database and reliance on external research may lead to erroneous estimates hence impacting selection of the right procurement approach..

e) Division users are unsure which templates to use for their procurement, e.g. Instructions to Tenderers (ITT) and Conditions of Contract (COC), which results in constant intervention by CAG procurement team.

Lastly, there are also concerns about the consistency and accuracy of WOC justification reviews, which are manually reviewed by individual procurement officers and hence, assessment may be subjective.

Individual officers may be unaware of similar past procurements, leading to inconsistent approvals and may cause frustration and confusion among division users.

## What the ideal solution should have

CAG seeks an artificial intelligence (AI) solution to automate the procurement process for both division users and the procurement team.

The solution should reduce the need for manual searches for information by guiding users through the procurement process step-by-step and provide past and existing procurement data to assist them on an appropriate procurement method to adopt.

The solution should meet the following 2 criteria:
1. Interactive generative platform. An interactive chatbot that interacts with users through prompters and search functions and respond with appropriate feedback and information according to the user’s requests, based on data points provided by the procurement team:
- Standard questions to address for each procurement submission
- Tender checklists
- Database of past procurement awards including requirement specifications, prices

2. Dynamic platform with automated insights. Capability to progressively learn and customise standard questions and prompts according to contextual cues from previous purchases made, past requirement specifications, market insights, and price reasonableness database, adapting dynamically to ensure relevant and effective prompting.

For the purpose of end-to-end procurement sourcing, the solution should be able to perform the following 2 key tasks:
1. Critical analysis, judgement, and recommendation to users on procurement approach.
Capability to critically evaluate and identify the end-to-end procurement sourcing, using data points provided by the procurement team by leveraging on the past award data.

2. Identify procurement templates and generate recommendations.
Capability to generate appropriate recommendations that guides users on:
- Relevant templates to utilise based on appropriate procurement approach e.g. draft requirement specifications, instructions to tenderers, CoC
- Draft first-cut requirement specifications and estimated procurement value including prompts enabling users to fine-tune recommendations to broaden access to suppliers
- Recommended list of relevant potential suppliers deriving from internal supplier database and past procurement awards
- Procedural next steps for respective procurement approaches
- Continuous learning from a feedback loop devised on recommendations engine to improve accuracy of future recommendations
